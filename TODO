TODO before release v1.0.0
==========================

- enh:

    - "global" argument (in mutex groups too)

- cleanup:

    - refactor exceptions to sg tree like stuff

    - remove all TODO from source

    - logging!!

- doc

    - add docstring to all public class and function

    - generic doc:
        - why is better than the alternatives

    - docstring abs method ref

other issues, ideas
===================

- API for get command tree  (or print)

- add types, eg: file exists, dir exists, etc...

- reusable arg "group" ??
